Evrything in javascript happens in execution context
Memory component is also called variable environment
javascrpt is a "Synchronous single threaded language"

In the hoisting the below will happen when we try to access

let - referrence error - variable is not defined
const - referrence error - variable is not defined
var - undefined because already as part of memory phase it is allocated with value undefined

let,cont - arrow function -  referrence error - variable is not defined
var - arrow function - since var values will be stored as variables in memory so stored as undefined but if you try accessing it as x() then it will throw error as not a function


in Javascript, there are 2 phases

1. Memory allocation phases
2. Execution phase

First step done by JS is to allocate ll the memory needed for all the variables and the functions

For a variables declared using var then in memory it is stored as "undefined"
For the functions declared using function keyword then it is stored as function definition fully
